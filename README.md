# vitarana_drone
This Project is divided into several tasks.

# Task 1
The objective of Task-1 is to achieve position control for eDrone in ROS-Gazebo environment, however this has been divided into sub tasks.
Task 1A - Designing attitude controller for the eDrone.
Task 1B - Designing position controller for the eDrone.

# Task 2
The objective of Task 2 is to pick a parcel box and deliver it to its destination.
Task 2A - Scanning the QR code and finding out the destination GPS co-ordinates.
Task 2B - Pick/Drop the parcel box.
Task 2C - Avoiding dynamic obstacles and planing the path.

# Task 3
The aim of this task is to detect the landing markers present in the general vicinity of a given GPS coordinate. The GPS coordinate of the landing marker will NOT be given, instead the coordinate will point somewhere around the marker. You have to hover at certain height from the given coordinates and scan for the landing marker by applying image processing techniques and design an algorithm to take the eDrone above the landing marker and eventually land on it.

# Task 4
The aim of this task is to complete a set of deliveries from warehouse to their destinations avoiding obstacles.

# Task 5
The aim of this task is to write a scheduler algorithm to plan the order of jobs (delivery or return) such that the the earnings of eDrone is maximum in the given time limit.

--> Learnings
1. First time introduced to the concept of Robot Operating System (ROS).
2. Learned how various nodes works and communicate with each other.
3. Got the hand on experience how PID tuning can be done.
4. Also got introduced to following other softwares like Gazebo,Plotjuggler.
